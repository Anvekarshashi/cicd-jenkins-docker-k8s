This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a full-stack application using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automates code checkout, Docker image build, push to Docker Hub, and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.
 
The application includes a React-based frontend form application and a Node.js + Express backend API integrated with MongoDB. Jenkins is used to orchestrate the CI/CD workflow, enabling automated deployments with zero manual intervention.
